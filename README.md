#What it does
Mello is an AI powered device which communicates with us on certain commands just like Amazon Alexa or Microsoft Cortona would do. Initially we designed Mello as a smartwatch which instructs any visually impaired person during any part of his daily life like it would help to reach a destination or avoid obstacles while walking. But as we moved on we decided to implement Braille into it such that they can also feel these instructions when necessary. Also we had some long discussions regarding how many cells we are going to put and together we decided to go with 6 blocks so that it would be easier to read long texts. We also added features like pulse rate verbal response presenting the current pulse rate of the individual and location services are also activated which will ensure the best route possible for the journey. Mello not only has verbal guidance throughout journey the person covers but also alerts about inconveniences or danger in the way.
